# Trump-or-Trudeau-Tweet-Analysis
Classification and Prediction of Tweets using NLP

In this project, I built a machine learning classifier that predicts whether the tweet was posted by President Trump or Prime Minister Trudeau. 

## Tools

- CountVectorizer & TfidfVectorizer from sklearn.feature_extraction.text.
- train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection.
- MultinomialNB from sklearn.naive_bayes.
- LinearSVC from sklearn.svm.
- metrics from sklearn

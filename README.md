# Trump-or-Trudeau-Tweet-Analysis
Classification and Prediction of Tweets using NLP


In this guided project, I built a machine learning classifier that knows whether the tweet was posted by President Trump or Prime Minister Trudeau. We work with the following:

- CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer from sklearn.feature_extraction.text.
- train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection.
- MultinomialNB from sklearn.naive_bayes.
- LinearSVC from sklearn.svm.
- metrics from sklearn
